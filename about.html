        <h2>izzy</h2>
        <p>I'm Izzy! I'm a millenial living in the Netherlands. I'm a research engineer in my day job, working with software and hardware. I'm bad at git and good at Python.</p>
        <p>In my free time I like to read, knit, and geocache.</p>
        <p>I manage a small army of Raspberry Pis running <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/" target="_blank">Home Assistant</a>, <a href="https://jellyfin.org/" target="_blank">Jellyfin</a> and <a href="https://pi-hole.net/" target="_blank">Pi-hole</a> to have ultimate control over my chaotically smart house.</p>
        <p>I like to use software that is open-source, de-centralized, and privacy-focused. I also try to follow the three R's: reduce, reuse, and recycle (in that order).</p>
        <h2>sttl</h2>
        <p>S·T·T·L comes from the Latin <i>sit tibi terra levis</i>, "may the ground rest lightly on you." It was, for a while, the Latin version of RIP. It was added at the end of many gravestones in the Roman world, which also hold stories about the people they were carved for and by.</p>
        <p>(You can also read the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sit_tibi_terra_levis" target="_blank">Wikipedia page</a> about it.)</p>
        <h2>website</h2>
        <p>The font used is <a href="https://www.brailleinstitute.org/freefont/" target="_blank">Atkinson Hyperlegible</a>, developed by the Braille Institute of America to be optimally legible for those with visual impairments. It's also just a nice font.</p>
        <p>The layout is inspired by the pages on <a href="now.garden" target="_blank">now.garden</a>.</p>
        <p>This page was originally hosted on <a href="https://neocities.org/" target="_blank">Neocities</a> before I bought my own domain. It is, for better or worse, hand-coded.</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.registry.google/tlds/boo/" target="_blank">Google Registry</a> would like me to add the following copy about the .boo domain: <i>"Whether you’re building a website for love, laughs, or a surprise, .boo is a fun and memorable domain that’s also secure."</i> So there's that.</p>
